# mozilla_common_voice_subset_prep
This project aims to prepare a random subset of the English Mozilla CommonVoice dataset that is ready for analysis for researchers to use. In this repository you can find all necessary scripts to extract the necessary metadata from the data files, as well as Praat scripts to create Praat Tables and run statistics from them.
